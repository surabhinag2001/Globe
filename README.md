# Globe

## About this application 
Globe is an application that helps the user make a bucket-list of countries they want to visit and keep a 
track of all countries they have visited in the past. It also allows them to step back into time and view memories 
from all their travels!
## Why I want to build it 
I have always been passionate about exploring different countries and learning about new cultures, so I want to
build an application using which I can form of collection of destinations that I hope to visit, and the
ones that I have already visited. My means of this project I will also be able to practically apply what I am learning
in this course.
